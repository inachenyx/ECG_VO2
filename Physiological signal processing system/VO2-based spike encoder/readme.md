# VO<sub>2</sub>-based asynchronous spike encoder
This is a VO<sub>2</sub>-based asynchronous spike encoder inspired by LC-ADCs and delta modulator circuits. The encoder converts an analog channel into a pair of UP and DOWN spike trains.
## Usage
Input an analog signal into the function provided in `vo2_encoder.py` to obtain the encoded spike trains.
